# Multiplayer--Phaser-

This project is an example of a multiplayer game using eureca.io and Phaser. It has been made with the aid of the tutorial avaialable at: http://ezelia.com/2014/tutorial-creating-basic-multiplayer-game-phaser-eureca-io 

Although the code for the tutorial is avaiable at the end, the issue is that it uses some deprecated syntax, which might be an issue when you use the latest version of eureca.io. This project does not contain any deprecated code as of 26th January, 2018. 

This project will require more modifications if lag is to be compensated.
